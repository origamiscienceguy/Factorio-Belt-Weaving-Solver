First, run the 1D script to generate a JSON file with all 1D braids up to a specified length.

Then, run the 2D script with the desired dimensions (must be less than the size specified in the 1D script). 
A menu will pup up with the available densities to choose from. 
Either:
-Enter a comma-separated list of the ID's of the densities you want to search.
-Or press Enter, which will run them all in descending order of density, stopping if it finds a solution.

Then wait.
